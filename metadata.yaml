description: "Little Fuzzy is a 1962 juvenile science fiction novel by H. Beam Piper,\
  \ now in public domain. It was nominated for the 1963 Hugo Award for Best Novel.\n\
  The story revolves around determining whether a small furry species discovered on\
  \ the planet Zarathustra is sapient, and features a mild libertarianism that emphasizes\
  \ sincerity and honesty.\nDuring a book signing at Strand Book Store, Piper alleged\
  \ that the Little Fuzzy series was inspired by an acquaintance named Kevin \"Fuzzy\"\
  \ Sheffield, whom Piper first met in a literary club in central Oregon. When asked\
  \ about Sheffield, Piper described him as \"a bizarre character, capable of writing\
  \ little more than a couple of vaguely-legible remarks in each letter. While I'm\
  \ sure he's full of insight and great ideas, it seems impossible to effectively\
  \ communicate with him on a conventional human level...terribly nice fellow however.\"\
  \nThe book was followed by a sequel, Fuzzy Sapiens (original title The Other Human\
  \ Race) published in 1964, the same year that Piper committed suicide in November.\n\
  In the wake of Piper's suicide, rumor spread of a lost \"second sequel\"; at the\
  \ behest of Ace Books, William Tuning produced the critically acclaimed Fuzzy Bones.\
  \ Later, Piper's lost manuscript was discovered, and published as Fuzzies and Other\
  \ People. Ace also hired Ardath Mayhar to write Golden Dreams: A Fuzzy Odyssey,\
  \ which tells the events of Little Fuzzy from the viewpoint of the Fuzzies (or Gashta,\
  \ as they call themselves).\nA new volume in the series, Fuzzy Ergo Sum by Wolfgang\
  \ Diehr, was published by Pequod Press in April 2011. A second book, Caveat Fuzzy\
  \ was released in August 2012. A third installment, this time by Wolfgang Diehr\
  \ & well known Piper historian John F. Carr, titled “Fuzzy Conundrum” published\
  \ in 2016. In 2011, John Scalzi published Fuzzy Nation, which he described as a\
  \ \"reboot\" of Piper's original.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
